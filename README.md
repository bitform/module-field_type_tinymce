## module-field_type_tinymce

Up until 2.1.0, Form Tools came with a baked-in WYSIWYG editor. This allowed the administrator to choose a rich-text editor for form fields, letting Form Tools users edit those field types with all the benefits of rich-text.
(A quick aside. In case you didn't already know, WYSIWYG stands for What You See Is What You Get - it's a commonly used term for rich-text editors. Moving on!).

With Form Tools 2.1.0, the WYSIWYG functionality was extracted and placed in a separate module. Partly this was due to the restructuring of the way field types are handled; partly it was simply because the WYSIWYG functionality wasn't central to the core functionality of the script and lent itself to being in a separate module.
